# ROFLPROXY

> When you are laughing on the floor, by proxy.

**NOTHING TO SEE HERE (YET)!** This is a way for me to play with Rust and async-std, async-rs etc.

## Goals

Play and have fun.

Create a tiny API gateway (or reverse proxy) that works with static file API definition and works with OpenID Connect protocol, esp. [distributed claims setup] while supporting multiple Identity Providers.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## TODOs

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for now. If things go further maybe there will be GH issues.
